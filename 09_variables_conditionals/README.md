####Weather Application - Part 1
_Time: 50min_


| Exercise | No solution file|
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Time__ | 45 min |
| __Topics__ | variables, DOM manipulation |
| __Description__| Three part exercise. The final version of the Temp Converter will take celsius temperature input convert it to  Fahrenheit and change the background image according to the weather. This exercise is the first step in that process|

Part 1:

*	As a class, write feature requirements / user stories necessary to create a fully functional application that takes celsius temperature, converts it to Fahrenheit and changes the background to match said temperature.

*	In groups of four write pseudo code for the application.

*	In pairs write the code to convert Celsius into Fahrenheit, and display the result in the browser.
